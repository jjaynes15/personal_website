Welcome!

I am an Associate Professor of Statistics and Mathematics at California State University, Fullerton. As a first-generation college graduate, I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles. My research focuses on statistical methods and applications, experimental design, and survey design. With this, I have a strong passion for working with undergraduate students on various research projects. For more information take a look at my 
[CV](/docs/CV/Jaynes-cv.pdf "CV").
