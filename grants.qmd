# Grants 

As part of my passion for facilitating undergraduate research opportunities, I am PI/co-PI on the following data science training grants

## California Learning Lab: Project PIPE-LINE 
### [Project PIPE-LINE Website](https://sites.google.com/fullerton.edu/project-pipeline)
I am PI of a Pathways Development grant from the California Learning Lab Grand Challenge: Building Critical Mass for Data Science, entitled Project PIPE-LINE (Programs for Institutional Pathway Engagement â€“ acceLerating INfrastructure and Education), in collaboration with University of California Irvine, Riverside City College, and Rio Hondo College.

# Research: Orthogonal Array Composite Designs (OACDs)
In general, my research agenda is centered around two areas of statistical design of experiments: fractional factorial designs (FFDs) and orthogonal array composite designs (OACDs). FFDs use an irreplaceable low-cost design methodology with a wide array of applications. My research in this area is focused on the development of new methodologies for constructing efficient FFDs. An OACD is a novel class of designs developed by my collaborators and I. OACDs build upon my research in FFDs by combining two- and three-level FFDs. OACDs offer numerous advantages to researchers in various disciplines, such as providing trade-offs between estimation efficiency and run size economy, stronger initial designs, and more in-depth analyses, as well as ease of use.
